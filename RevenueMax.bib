  Abstract                 = {A seller wishes to sell an object to one of multiple bidders. The valuations of the bidders are privately
known. We consider the joint design problem in which the seller can decide the accuracy by which bidders
learn their valuationandto whom to sell at what price. We establish that optimal information structures in an
optimal auction exhibit a number of properties: (i) information structures can be represented by monotone
partitions, (ii) the cardinality of each partition is finite, (iii) the partitions are asymmetric across agents. We
show that an optimal information structure exists.},
